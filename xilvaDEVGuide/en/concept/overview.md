# Overview
If ROS is a system that turns all of the robot softwares into a generalized format to control the robot hardware,

Then xilva is a system that keeps the generalization of ROS, 
while, customizes for android robots when using the generalized android softwares to control different android robots.

xilva, cyber-physics interface of linking various androids.

These are android robots. They have human apperances, they speak, move, behave like a human. These make android robots unique and different from normal humanoids.

The purpose to design xilva, is to make a reusable behavioral system for these androids. So that every time in this world a new android is born, this android can happlily use xilva as its own behavior system without any compatibilty problems.

The most amazing thing of xilva is it starts its design from a human. Human kinesiology, human behaviors, even human anatomy.
It means at last, users just need to input simple on/off to generate human-like behaviors on all of the androids using xilva.

"Anthropomorphism, incurable disease." However, instead of creating a serious world, we try to make creating human-like behaviors in robots a little bit easy, without thinking about metaphysics.

We believe that in computer graphics, human-liked agents can change humans' cognition. 

We also believe that in the real world, the same thing will happen.

Xilva appreciates to anyone who has interest in it, make contribution to/with it.
